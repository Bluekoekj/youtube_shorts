# Why YouTube Shorts is a bad platform made by Google

Hi there! Before you start, these are my personal opinions, and you don't have to agree with them. (Although I think you should)

Lets just get this overwith

### Free Robux and Vbucks scams

Ah yes, who wouldn't forget the worst kinds of videos on the platform. I rage at these **SO BAD** when they appear in my Shorts feed. They usually attract fake bot 
subscribers, and earn a checkmark, and even a silver play button. Heck, my main YouTube channel is used without spambots, and its nice to work to get subscribers, so 
thats a pretty nice payday!
